# cenlog
Cenlog is a program for having a central logging library with a few functions.\
\
!! IMPORTANT !!\
It is not ment to edit the lib.txt manually. I cannot guarantee the function of the script after editing it manually.\
Please use Cenlog to edit it.\
\
The first two lines of the lib.txt should never be changed. \
If it is otherwise just add following two lines to the beginning:\
ID | Name | Path\
0 | Default | Default

Have fun,\
